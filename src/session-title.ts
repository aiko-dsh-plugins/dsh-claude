/** Answer DSH's auxiliary session-title request with a throwaway Haiku turn.
 *

 *  a summary of the first human message. That route is this plugin, and the
 *  session's Claude process must not answer it: the title call carries a
 *  plugin-authored system prompt and would land in the user's transcript. A
 *  separate one-shot turn keeps it out, for the same reasons as the branch-name
 *  summary and the plan-usage probe. Deployments that never installed a second
 *  model provider still get a readable title, since the only model this plugin
 *  needs is the one it already runs. */
